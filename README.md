# Dicer v1.0

This project can convert your images into images made using numbers on a die. 
If you implement it in real life using dice, you'll get an accurate representation of the input image.

Inspired by this (https://old.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/a411hu/i_made_a_portrait_of_a_friend_out_of_13000_dice/)[Reddit Post]

## Usage

`python3 dice.py [-h] [-r RESOLUTION] [-V] Filename`

## Future enhancements

1. Create a web interface and render dice on it to show the output
2. Create and export JSON into a user defined file
